		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<p>Hi there! Welcome to my wonderful and amazing page. A little bit about myself is that I graduated from UCLA with a degree in biology in 2011. I currently work for a microbiological lab that specializes in food safety. I chose to get into coding because I felt as though a career change was in order and that it seems like a very interesting and exciting skill to learn.
		</p>

		<p>Outside of work, I am a huge Lakers! Basketball has always been an important part of my life. I enjoy both watching and playing the sport. Some other interests of mine include the Game of Thrones series and attending concerts and festivals. I am also a huge dog lover with 2 beautiful huskies. That is just a little bit about me!!
